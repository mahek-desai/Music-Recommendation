#Top 10 Music Recommender â€“ Machine Learning Project
This project is a Music Recommendation System that suggests the top 10 songs based on user preferences using Cosine Similarity in Machine Learning. It analyzes song features and user listening history to recommend tracks that are most similar to the given input.

Key Features
Content-Based Filtering: Uses Cosine Similarity to find similar songs based on audio features.
Top 10 Recommendations: Suggests the most relevant songs to the user.
Feature-Based Analysis: Compares songs using attributes like tempo, energy, valence, danceability, and genre.
Scalable Dataset: Works with large music datasets (e.g., Spotify, Last.fm, Kaggle datasets).
Machine Learning Approach
Data Preprocessing:

Load dataset (song metadata, audio features).
Normalize and vectorize numerical features.
Cosine Similarity Calculation:

Compute the cosine distance between feature vectors.
Identify the top 10 most similar songs.
Recommendation Output:

User inputs a song.
The system retrieves and displays top 10 recommendations.
Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
Cosine Similarity (from sklearn.metrics.pairwise)
Flask (Optional) for building a web-based interface
Spotify API (Optional) for real-time music data
How to Use
Provide a song name or audio features as input.
The system computes Cosine Similarity to find similar tracks.
View the Top 10 recommended songs based on similarity scores.
Applications
Personalized music recommendations based on listening habits.
Can be integrated into streaming platforms for enhanced user experience.
Helps users discover new songs similar to their preferences.
This ML-powered music recommender demonstrates the power of vector similarity and recommendation systems in real-world applications.
